# Introduction
$\dots$

Our objectives were threefold: (1) Examine whether the single step prediction
framework can be transfered to hybrids, (2) explore the utility of single step 
predition with a quantitative predictor and (3) evaluate the impact of the
particular genetic space covered by the incomplete predictor on predictive
ability.
