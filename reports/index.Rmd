# Preface {-}
This book covers an extension of the methodology of single-step prediction 
&mdash; which was developed for the imputation of SNP data from pedigree 
information &mdash; to the imputation of quantitative predictor variables using
genomic information.

The companion R-package for this analysis is [sspredr](https://github.com/mwesthues/sspredr).
The development version can be installed from Github:
```{r Install_sspred, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mwesthues/sspredr")
```
